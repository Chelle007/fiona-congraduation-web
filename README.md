# 🎓 Graduation Congrats Portal

This is a special graduation gift for our dear friend, **Fiona**, from **Michelle and Desmond**. This little website is a celebration of you and your amazing achievement.

## 🔄 Data Flow

This is how the congratulatory messages get from friends to the website:

*   Google Form → Friends submit their messages (Name, Message, maybe Photo URL).
*   Google Sheets → Automatically stores all the responses.
*   Next.js Backend → Reads the Google Sheets data.
*   Frontend UI → Maps over the messages and displays them as animated cards or sticky notes.

## ✨ Features ✨

This website is packed with love, memories, and a little bit of magic:

*   **A Personal Welcome:**
*   **Interactive Scratch Card:**
